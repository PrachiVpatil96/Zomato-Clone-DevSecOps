 ## **Step 1. Launch an Ubuntu 22.04 EC2 Instance with size `t2.large`machine** 
   1. You can attached an Elastic Ip address so that if you stopped your machine you can get an same ip address but look into an cost optimization in aws or azure .
   2. Here I am using an Aws cloud.

   3. I have attched an Elastic-ip to my instance.

## ***steps for elastic ip***

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Allocate an Elastic IP**
1. Sign in to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard**.

1. Go to **Elastic IPs** in the EC2 Dashboard.
2. Select the allocated IP and click **Actions > Associate Elastic IP address**.

 ### Installing Jenkins 
 1. Install Jdk-17 on your machine for jenkins
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk

sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
```
#### After the docker installation, we create a sonarqube container (Remember to add 9000 ports in the security group).

```sh
docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community
```
1. Now our sonarqube is up and Running.
